# Example Next-Redux-Wrapper TypeScript Problem

For DefinitelyTyped's `@types/next-redux-wrapper`, issue
[#24293](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/24293)

Either open `/test/pages/index.spec.tsx` in Visual Studio Code (with
TypeScript support installed) or run `npm run lint`, which applies
type checking and should show the same error:

> Error at test/pages/index.spec.tsx:9:30: JSX element type 'Index'
> does not have any construct or call signatures.
